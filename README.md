# CodeLens Docu

This is based on the a sample extension that shows the usage of the CodeLens API.

It is not intended as a production quality extension.

- Create a new file or open an existing file
- Write anything, currently the codelense gets put above "import..."->payload is the code that comes after "import" and "class..."-> payload is the class
- Click on the CodeLens for action example
- Can be enabled or disabled by command palette

## Demo

## VS Code API

### `languages` module

- [`languages.registerCodeLensProvider`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#languages.registerCodeLensProvider)

### CodeLens Provider

- [`CodeLensProvider`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#CodeLensProvider)
- [`CodeLensProvider.provideCodeLenses`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#CodeLensProvider.provideCodeLenses)
- [`CodeLensProvider.resolveCodeLens`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#CodeLensProvider.resolveCodeLens)

## Debugging/Running the Sample via source:

- Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- set chat-GPT key via https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety
- Run the `Run Extension` target in the Debug View. This will:
	- Start a task `npm: watch` to compile the code
	- Run the extension in a new VS Code window


## Where to start if I want to edit the output and functionality: 
- Edit the documentation output via the function `generateSummary` in `./src/CodelenseProvider.ts` 
- Edit the regex or the openAI API request to change the captured code or the manipulation chatgpt is doing
- Test via the debugging steps above


## To build the CodeLens sample and activate it in VS Code, you can follow these general steps:

Install the VSCE tool by running the command "npm install -g vsce" in your terminal.

Navigate to the root directory of your extension.
Run the command "vsce package" to create a VSIX file of your extension.

The VSIX file will be generated and saved to the root

In the Extensions view, click on the "..." menu icon (â ‡) next to your extension folder and select "Install from VSIX...".

Enable the plugin in the command palette
